# Experiment 1

**What is this?**

An experimental vue data table using an idea from an experiment I built years ago in vanilla js.

**What Makes This Different?**

The table renders a set constant number of rows, as the user scrolls the same set of rendered rows is updated
and shifted upwards or downwards to give the appearance of scrolling. Think of the table as a sliding window
viewing a set amount of rows at a time.

## Features

-   Mouse wheel scrolling support on table
-   Totally custom fake scrollbar
-   Scrollbar info popup giving user context as they scroll
-   Infinite scrolling type loading of new records from API

## Pros

-   Very fast performance, even built in development mode (production would be even faster)
-   Constant (and low) use of DOM elements. No matter how many records are loaded the table will always have the
    same amount of DOM elements.
-   Can load bigger chunks of records from server using infinite scroll and not take up page space
-   No need to scroll the entire page. Table/page controls always visible
-   User can scrub through records with context. So for example they could easily find where a sorted column's values change.

## Cons

-   User experience might be confusing at first
-   Requires some amount of locking column widths otherwise the columns can jump around as you scroll through variable length content.
-   Might be difficult to get working with phones/tablets (should be possible though)
-   Will the constant updating of the same table row DOM elements cause a lot of CPU/GPU/Memory thrashing? My testing so
    far says no but how will it work on less powerful machines/browsers.

## Further things to try

-   How well does this work in a card view scenario?
-   Add traditional page buttons in addition to scrolling. As user scrolls which page the user was on would change. Allow user to
    jump to any page and get the best of all worlds.
